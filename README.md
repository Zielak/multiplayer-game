# ARCHIVED

This project has been split into 2 seperate libs:

- https://github.com/Zielak/cardsGame-client
- https://github.com/Zielak/cardsGame-server

I'm continuing my work over there. One major change is the use of TypeScript.

# multiplayer-game

## dev

Run the node server in one terminal:

```npm start```

Run the webpack-dev-server for the client-side code in the other terminal:

```npm run server```

Node server with WebSockets runs at `localhost:2657`

You want to open `localhost:8080` in the browser!
